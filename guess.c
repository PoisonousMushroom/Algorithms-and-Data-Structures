/*
The best algorithm that can be used for such a search is the binary
search which basically finds the index(in this context the actual value)
of the number, working with a complexity of Î¸(log(n)), which is the best
as it takes as much as log(n) steps to find the index of the value,
a sublogarithmic algorithm being nonexistent as of now.
